## Morris Screening
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/hse/PyHexamollDINCH/master?filepath=morris.ipynb)

Click the above launcher to start a MyBinder server and load the Morris screening notebook.

If you are new to notebooks:

1. MyBinder displays a preview while it carries out its start-up routine. Wait for it to finish before continuing.

2. Run each code cell by clicking the play button to the left of the cell. Alternatively, press Ctrl+Enter to run a highlighted cell, or Shift+Enter to run a highlighted cell and move to the next cell.

3. Return to the top of the notebook and use the form to configure a Morris run. Here are some inputs to try:

  * Parameters: HEME, MPY, MPYgu
  * Target output: Curine
  * Trajectories: 5
  
4. Click the ```Run Morris``` button. It may take several minutes for the analysis to run to completion.

## Alternative to MyBinder

At the time of writing, [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/) provides a faster runtime, but requires more effort on the part of the user to set up.
